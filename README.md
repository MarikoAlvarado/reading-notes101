## What does it mean to have a "growth mindset"?
Having a "growth mindset" means that I believe in my ability to constantly evolve and become greater by staying open minded to new possibilities and opportunities to grow. Having such a mindset also means that I will celebrate others who are also growing and succeeding as they work towards their goals because a competitive mindset will only hold me back.

### How can I maintain a "growth mindset"?
1. Learn from mistakes, _do not_ ignore them.
2. Ask questions and search for answers vs ~~staying quiet and confused~~
3. When things get tough,keep going! _do not_ quit.
