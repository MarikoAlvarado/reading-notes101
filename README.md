# Mariko's Reading Notes
This is where I will be documenting all of my reading notes for CODE102.

## I have a "growth mindset", but what does that mean?
Having a "growth mindset" means that I believe in my ability to constantly learn new skills, obtain greater knowledge and become smarter each new day. Having such a mindset also means that I will celebrate others who are also growing and succeeding as they work towards their goals because a competitive mindset will only hold me back.

### How can I maintain a "growth mindset"?
** I will learn from my mistakes, I _will not_ ignore them.
** I will ask questions and search for answers instead of~~staying quietly confused~~
** When things get tough I will keep going, I _will not_ quit.
