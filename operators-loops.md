# JAVASCRIPT Reading Notes

## Duckett: Duckett: JS&JQuery

### Comparison and Logical Operators

- == *is equal to* for numbers, strings or booleans

- != *is not equal to* for numbers, strings or booleans

- === *strict equal to* check if data type and values are same

- !== *strict not equal to* check that data type and values are **not** the same

- *< or >*

- *<= or >=*

#### Logical Operators
Can compare results of more than one comparison operator by:

- && *to test more than one condition*

- || *to test at least one of the conditions, resulting in all as either true or false*

- ! *inverts a single boolean, if !true return false, if !false return true*

#### For and While loops
Loops continue to run until returned false. **for loops** uses a counter as a condition. There are three types of **for loops**:

- **for** code runs for specific number of times it is told

- **while** loops continuously as long as condition is *true*

- **do-while** runs at least once even if condition is *false*
