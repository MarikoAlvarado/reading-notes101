# Learning Markdown!

## What is "Markdown" and how should you use it?

- Markdown is a way to style the text used on webpages. Markdown is also used to insert images, gifs, and links to other pages
- Sometimes non-alphabetic characters, for example  "#" and "-" are used along with regular to text in order to direct what style that bit of text is
- Github.com has its own version of Markdown Syntax
- Take a few minutes to read up on the basics @ ["Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## What is Github Pages?

- Github is one of the many ways you can build _your own_ website
- Use it to create repositories that generate into webpages, you can even choose webpage layouts or "profile styles" directly through Github
- Use it to document, build portfolios, projects and more
- you _do not_ need to know how to work on the back end, and by using markdowns while creating your webpage you can skip trying to figure out HTML and CSS

### How does it work?

- By creating your own profile, Github will generate for you, _your very own URL_
- Create your own repository, add web content to the master branch and the webpage will become part of your URL showing you (or your organization) as the publisher!
- Github uses Jekyll which is an open source tool which will convert your text into a more appealing format, structuring it's presentation into a more appealing website. You have the option to select a free, pre made themes in the settings of your repository
- Github will _automatically_ create and publish your website for you, even as you make edits and update what is to be included in its contents
- Learn about all of the other features and abilities @ ["pages.github.com"](https://pages.github.com/)
