# Computer Architecture and Logic

#### What makes a computer?

The invention of computers came from the desire to have a machine that would assist with the thinking work it takes to accomplish our goals. Computer were designed to do four things with information. The ability to *input, store, process and output* information.

The information within computers is carried through wires and circuits. Electricity flowing through wires, information can be be processed as 1 or 0 true or false and similarly in other ways starting with the basic example of electricity either being on or off. More electrical wires equals more bits that can represent even more complex information beyond two different options. 

The binary number system which uses two digits are used to represent diffent values multiplied by 2. So any number can be represented using only 1 and 0 (wires that are either on or off). so the more wires there are, the more number representation. Text and the letters that make them up can also be represented by numbers in sequence as numbers correlate with letters. Colors in images are made up of pixels, pixels have a color and each color is represented by numbers. Sound in waveform can be broken down to a series of numbers, selected by bits. Higher bits result in higher levels of sound.

Inputs and outputs are a type of information represented by *on* or *off*. To modify and process information of input or output signals a computer needs millions of components that create circuits. Circuits flips electrical signals. signal going in become *not* output. There are different types of circuits that complete calculation such as *and,nand,not,nor,or and zor* but they can work together to solve complex calculations.
