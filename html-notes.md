### Structure

How a well a webpage is structured will determine the success in catching and keeping the attention of the audience. When creating a structure, it is important to do so with the goal of clearly stating and portraying the message to be delivered, and making the different pages easily accessible and relevent to the overal goal. 

The structure of a webpage first, consists of organizing bodies of texts, photos and other information into headings, subheading, paragraphs and a footing.

HTML code within angled brackets **<>** which makes them *elements*. Elements are made up by **tags** showing as opening and closing. For example **<> </>**. When a bunch of HTML elements are put together, the structure of a webpage and the contents within each section will begin to show form by *priority*

This is the start of creating a webpage's wireframe.

### Different Versions of HTML

No longer recommended to be used by modern day creators. it's pretty out of date.

#### HTML5 - In progress

In this version, creators will **not** need to close all tags. New elements and attributes are in the mix as well. Although it is not yet complete, creators can use some of the features as long as we are mindful of how users with older browsers, may or may not be able to view webpages.

### HTML5

HTML5 is introducing new elements that result in clearer code and the ability to better show and describe a the overall structure of a webbpage.

Older browsers won't recognize these newer element and must be told which elements are "block-level".

Extra JS needs to be installed in Internet Explorers 8 and older in order for the new HTML5 elements to work.

### Designing My Website

#### Who is my target audience?

- Is it a company, or an individual? Age? Gender? Where do they live? What level of Education do they have? What kind of device are they using to view the site? etc.
- What are visitors looking for? What is the goal?
- Do I need to include information so they can contact me?
- What information do they need? Am I telling them about a project, service or sharing general information?
- *how often do I need to update my website?*
- Do I need to include a nav bar? How should I organize the site into sections or pages while maintaing focus on the goals?
