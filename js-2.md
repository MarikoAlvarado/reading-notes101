# JAVASCRIPT Reading Notes

## Duckett: JS&JQUERY Intro + Scripts: Pages 1 - 24

### How does Javascript make your webpage more interactive?

- It can be used to access from an HTML page by referencing elements

- JS can be used to add or remove elements and attributes from an HTML page

- Rules can be made giving a browser step by step instructions for how contents of page will work

- JS can be told to reacts a certain way when there are certain actions taken by users like clicking a button or moving the cursor over an HTML element 

### Writing Javascript

1. Start by writing out your goal like *tell a robot how to put on a hoodie*

2. Break down that goal by a series of tasks like *pick up hoodie, lift over head...*

3. Create a code for each step in Javascript

### Taking it from steps to code

- understand JS language

- **Vocabulary** - what can the computer understand?

- **Syntax** - How can the words be put together as instructions that the computer can understand? 

- **Programmatic Approach** - understand how a computer uses this approach to problem solve

**LEARN TO THINK LIKE A COMPUTER!!**

*REMEMBER*

- Sketch out tasks in a flow-chart

- design the goal and design the script!


## Expressions + Operators: Pages 74 - 79

### Expressions

**expressions result in a single value**

1. Assign a value to a variable **var color = 'black';**

2. A variable might use more that one value to result in a single value **var area = 2 * 400;**

### operators

*expressions **need** operators which let creators get a single value from one or more values

- Combining strings

- Computing Basic Match

- Comparison operators

- Logical operators

**Arithmetic Operators**

- Addition **+** or Subtraction **-**

- Division **/** or Multiplication **(*)**

- Increments **++** or Decrements **--** either adding one or subtracting one

- Modulus **%** Dividing two values and giving back the remainder

**String Operators**

- you can join together two or more strings using **+** 

**check example on pages 78-79**

## Functions: Pages 88 - 94

### What Does a Function Do?

- you can group a series of statements in order to perform a task

- you can reuse the same functino in different parts of a script rather that repeating the same statement

- functions let you store which steps are needed to perform a task

- functions must be given a **name** so that when you *call* the function it knows it's task

- Steps for a funciton are in a code block *{'stepsoffunctionhere}*

**A BASIC FUNCTION** holds the statements until the function is called for

**Declaring a function** 

- simply declare function by starting with it the *function* keyword followed by the function name

- remember to enclose the code block using *curly braces {}*

- the function can be called later throughout code by writing *functionName* follow this by parenthesis and the semi colon.

**Declaring functions that need info**

- Give the function parameter within it;s code block which act as variabels

- make note of what you the function will need to complete the task

**Call the function needing info**

- specify the values that are to be used within within the parenthesis

- there are argument values and argument variables. 

*functions can return information of a single value/what is left of the resul of a calculation that was called for*
example: var area
         **return area**
