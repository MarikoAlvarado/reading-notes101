### What is Javascript?

Javascript is just one of the multiple layers which build a webpage, the other layer in most cases is HTML and CSS and together they are **progressive enhancement** in page building.

#### Creating Javascript

Javascript is written in plain text like HTML and CSS.

- It is a *.js* file

-JS files can live in folders **js., scripts or javascript**

- In HTML, JS is used within the **<script></script>** element

#### Objects and Methods

**document** = represents the entire webpage
**write('*message here*')** = the content can be written on the page where *script* element is

- together it shows as *document. write('message here);*

#### JS Basics

**Statements** are individual instructions which make up a script ending with **;**

- *green* is the statement

- *pink* indicate start & end of the codeblock

- *purple* determines which code should run

**Comments** describe for you and others what the code does

- *green* JS code

- *pink* multiple lines of *comments*

- *gray* single line of *comments*

#### Variables

Variables are where a scripts data is stored. Data within variables can 'calculate' or 'compute' numbers or other types of data.

**declaring a variable** = *var quantity = 1;*

**numeric data** = *0.45*

**string type data** = *'what is up!'*

**BOOLEAN data** = *true* or *false*

- Variables can store strings which are placed inside of either single or double quotes

- *if using single quotes in the string, surround the entire string and the single quotes with double quotes OR the other way around* 

#### Naming Variables

1. Must begin with a letter *$* or **_** - no numbers!

2. Name can contain the same as above but no **-** or **.**

3. No keywords or eserved words (words to be used in the future)

4. Variables are case sensitive! 

5. use a name that describes the information example: **myName**

6. If name is made of more than one word, separate with an uppercase letter after first word as shown above
